# Shatterline AutoHotKey B-Hop

This is a very basic AutoHotKey script that will simply spam the spacebar in Shatterline. This script is designed to not spam the spacebar outside of the game, like many other macro programs would do. 

## Usage
1. Install [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Launch the script
3. Open Shatterline
4. Hold down space to continually spam the spacebar, making it exponentially easier to initiate a bhop.

## Known Issues
Occasionally, it can get stuck spamming space. I'm not sure if this is an error for everyone, or if this is just for me as Python also had the same anomalous activity. Either way, I cannot think of a way to fix it. If this happens to you, please let me know.
